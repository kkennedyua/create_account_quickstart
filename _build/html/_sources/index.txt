Goal
----

.. raw:: html

   <!---
   Avoid covering upstream and downstream steps that are not explicitly and necessarily part of the tutorial - write or link to separate quick starts/tutorials for those parts
   --->

.. raw:: html

   <!---
   A few sentences (50 words or less) describing the ultimate goal of the steps in this tutorial
   --->

This Quick Start walks you through the steps to creating a CyVerse
account. Your CyVerse account gives you access to several different apps
and services, including the Discovery Enviroment and the CyVerse Wiki,
which contains how-to information, and subscribes you to that service's
email notifications about maintenance periods and outages, and to
CyVerse's newsletter, *Node*.

In addition, there are other CyVerse services, such as Atmosphere and
BisQue, to which you may request access.

In addition to the default services that are provided to you when you
sign up for a new account, you can request access to others. For more
information on the list of all CyVerse apps and platforms, see the
CyVerse `Products <http://www.cyverse.org/products>`__ web page.

1. Go to the `CyVerse user management
   portal <https://user.cyverse.org/>`__, click **Login** at the top,
   and enter your CyVerse username and password.

2. In the **Available Services** section at the bottom of the Apps &
   Services tab, find the app or service to add, and then click
   **Request Access**.

3. Repeat for each service to add.

4. If requesting access to Atmosphere, specify the instance size,
   including the number of CPUs, memory in GB, and root storage in GB,
   needed for your instance.

   **Start small.** Start with the smallest size until you know for
   certain which size you need. You can always size up but you can't
   size down.

.. note:: If you did not use an institutional email address (as required
by Atmosphere), you will need to `change your email
address <http://www.cyverse.org/learning-center/manage-account#ChangeEmail>`__.

5. When the service has been added, you will receive an email with
   access instructions and may begin using the service.
